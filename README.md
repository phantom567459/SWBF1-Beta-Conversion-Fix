# SWBF1-Beta-Conversion-Fix
This program allows the user to convert a compiled BF1 beta model file (March 2004 build) to something that can be consumed by the retail game.  Requires editing of the global file header to consume

I correctly edit the headers of each model but not the global file, maybe I can fix it before public release.

Please enter argument in this fashion - program.exe <NAME-IN> <NAME-OUT>
-r can be added to the end as an experimental reverse flag

(Reverse flag meaning it can take retail Xbox files and add the bad header to make it readable by the demo.  This has worked but not thoroughly tested.)
